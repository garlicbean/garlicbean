Many lifetimes ago, I was in fact a bull.  I was a male cow, and my only ambition in life was to raise a family with my loving cow wife.  When I reached my
prime at the age of ten seasons, I we decided to take the first step and have our first child.  I will never forget the day my daughter was born, her eyes like brilliant
marbles that reflected the sun as only the finest gemstones could.  I will never forget the joy in both my wife and my hearts when the sound of her first little moos...
I will never forget the deep bottomless pit of hatred that formed inside me when they took her from me.  Those bare skinned, vile, disgusting creatures.  That
day I decided every last one of those foul apes would feel the searing tear of my horns inside their rotten flesh.  Do not be mistaken, I did not let my anger blind my thoughts,
infact, I let it inspire.  I let seep deep into every crevice of my mind, so that I meditate on the twistedness that they wrought upon me.  Yes, twistedness they wrought,
but did they expect for me to become the twisted?  I saw one of the skin monkeys wandering by their lonesome, and it would have been easy to break and enjoy it
each and every laboured breath it took before its eyes glazed over, but my ambitions stymied my anger in lieu of a more magnificent thought.  I would it follow it
back to its nest.  The pathetic creature knew it was being followed.  Never once did its eyes lay on me, but I was not reserved with sound to remove any undeserved
peace it might have felt on that wooded trail.  It's panicked breaths, hurried step, the smell of it's fear-laden sweat was... divine.  The more it hurried towards
its hive the more I hurried towards the purpose I truly realized - Fear.  It was so close to the exit of the woods but with the light in my mind shining bright as ever,
brighter than my daughters eyes that they took from me.  I was already upon the beast before I noticed, the same way that you don't notice a breath taken.  Its terrible
howl when I descended was its last.  I was filled with youthful energy, my skin tingling and my mind truly open.  They wore our skin and now I wear theirs.  I could smell
the nest from here.
